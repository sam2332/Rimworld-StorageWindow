# [PL] Storage Window

A smart pass-through window system for RimWorld that enables seamless item transfer between rooms while maintaining perfect climate separation.

![Storage Window Preview](About/Preview.png)

## Overview

The Storage Window mod introduces intelligent pass-through windows that automatically route items to their final storage destinations. These windows act as climate barriers while serving as stepping stones in your colony's supply chain, ensuring items flow efficiently to where they need to go.

## Key Features

### üîÑ **Intelligent Auto-Routing**
- Items don't get stuck in windows - they automatically flow to better storage
- Uses RimWorld's priority system (Critical > Important > Normal > Preferred > Low)
- Smart pathfinding considers distance, filters, and colonist availability

### üå°Ô∏è **Climate Barrier**
- Maintains temperature and atmosphere separation between rooms
- Perfect for keeping cold storage isolated while allowing item transfer
- Blocks wind and weather like a regular wall

### üì¶ **Smart Priority System**
- Defaults to "Low" priority to encourage pass-through behavior
- Prefers final storage destinations over transit windows
- Integrates seamlessly with RimWorld 1.6 storage systems

### üîß **Auto-Rotation**
- Automatically aligns with wall placement direction
- No manual rotation needed - just place and it works

### üè∑Ô∏è **Storage Group Integration**
- Works with RimWorld 1.6 storage group systems
- Compatible with existing storage mods

## How It Works

1. **Initial Placement**: Colonists haul items to storage windows as intermediate storage
2. **Continuous Scanning**: Every second, windows check for better storage options
3. **Automatic Transfer**: When better storage becomes available, colonists automatically move items
4. **Smart Selection**: System considers priority, distance, filters, and colonist availability
