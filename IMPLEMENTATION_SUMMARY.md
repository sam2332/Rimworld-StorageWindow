# StorageWindow Mod - Implementation Summary

## Version History

### Mod Renaming & RimWorld 1.6 Update

**Date**: Current Session  
**Updates Made**:

1. **Mod Renaming from PassThroughWindow to StorageWindow**
   - Updated all namespace references from `PassThroughWindow` to `StorageWindow`
   - Renamed class from `Building_PassThroughWindow` to `Building_StorageWindow`
   - Updated defName in XML from `PassThroughWindow` to `StorageWindow`
   - Renamed all project files and assemblies to use StorageWindow naming
   - Updated AssemblyInfo and project configuration files

2. **Version Compatibility Update**
   - Updated `About.xml` supportedVersions from 1.5 to 1.6
   - Updated `Project.csproj` assembly name from "ModTemplate" to "StorageWindow"
   - Added 1.6 storage group support in `StorageWindow.xml`

3. **Major Routing Optimization Implementation**
   - **Problem Identified**: Storage windows were acting as final storage destinations rather than intermediate transit points
   - **Solution Implemented**: Smart auto-forwarding system based on RimWorld's hauling AI

### Key Features Added

#### Auto-Forwarding System
- **Low Priority Default**: Pass-through windows now default to "Low" storage priority, making them less attractive than proper storage
- **Automatic Item Transfer**: Items placed in pass-through windows are automatically moved to better storage when:
  - Higher priority storage becomes available
  - Colonists with hauling enabled are free
  - Better storage location is accessible

#### Technical Implementation Details

**Building_StorageWindow.cs Enhancements**:
- `Tick()` override: Runs auto-forward check every 60 ticks (1 second)
- `TryAutoForwardItems()`: Scans held items and finds better storage destinations
- `TryCreateAutoForwardJob()`: Creates hauling jobs for available colonists
- `FindAvailableHauler()`: Intelligently selects the best colonist for the job
- `GetInspectString()`: Provides user feedback about storage window behavior

**XML Configuration Updates**:
- Added `defaultStorageSettings` with Low priority in `StorageWindow.xml`
- Maintains backward compatibility with existing installations

### How It Works

1. **Initial Placement**: Items are hauled to pass-through windows as intermediate storage
2. **Priority Routing**: RimWorld's hauling system prefers higher-priority destinations
3. **Auto-Forward Trigger**: Every second, the window checks for better storage options
4. **Smart Selection**: System finds the best available storage considering:
   - Storage priority (Critical > Important > Normal > Preferred > Low)
   - Distance from current location
   - Item acceptance filters
   - Colonist availability and pathfinding

### Benefits for Players

- **Improved Flow**: Items naturally flow through windows to final destinations
- **Reduced Micromanagement**: No need to manually set priorities or manage transfers
- **Better Pathfinding**: Colonists use windows as stepping stones for efficient item routing
- **Flexible Usage**: Can still be used as regular storage if desired by changing priority

### Performance Considerations

- **Throttled Processing**: Only one item processed per tick to avoid performance impact
- **Smart Filtering**: Skips reserved items and unreachable destinations
- **Efficient Algorithms**: Uses RimWorld's existing optimized hauling system

### Future Enhancement Potential

- Configurable auto-forward delay
- Priority-based forwarding logic
- Integration with storage group preferences
- Advanced routing algorithms for complex base layouts

*This implementation follows RimWorld 1.6 best practices and maintains compatibility with existing mods through careful use of reflection and standard game interfaces.*
