	<description>A smart pass-through window system for seamless item transfer between rooms! 

These windows automatically route items to their final storage destinations while maintaining perfect climate separation. Place them in walls to create efficient supply chains - colonists will use them as stepping stones, and items will automatically flow to better storage when available.

How it works: The system continuously scans for better storage options using RimWorld's priority system (Critical > Important > Normal > Preferred > Low). When a higher-priority storage zone, stockpile, or container becomes available and accessible, colonists will automatically move items from the pass-through window to the better destination. Distance, item filters, and colonist availability are all considered to find the optimal final storage location.

Features:
• Intelligent auto-routing - items don't get stuck in windows
• Climate barrier - maintains temperature/atmosphere separation  
• Smart priority system - prefers final storage over transit
• Auto-rotation - aligns perfectly with wall placement
• Storage group integration - works with RimWorld 1.6 systems

Perfect for kitchen supply lines, workshop material flow, or any situation where you need items to pass through walls efficiently!</description>
